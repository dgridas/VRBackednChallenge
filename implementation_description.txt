Look at HdrBoxReader appsettings.json to know about necessary settings for DB(Postgres) and file system.

Before run application please ensure listening folder was created with write permissions for user.

I use Dapper for access to database.

Writing to DB happen by chunks defined in appsettings.json.

Just put data file into listening folder after starting the app (HdrBoxReader).

You can install DBeaver(management tool) to check stored SQL data in database.


For architecture was used n-tier solution design.
Solution splitted to 4 layers in different projects:
-BLL - bussiness logic
-DAL - data acess
-BO - bussines object
-and HdrBoxReader - concole application whcih also is representation layers

All logic implemented in short clases with following single responsibility principle.

Solution use dependecy injection library and useful for unit testing with easy mocking of dependecies.
